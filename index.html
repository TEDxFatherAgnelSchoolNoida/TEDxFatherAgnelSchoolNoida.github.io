        <h1>Horizons of change - Dreams, Visions and Reality</h1>

        <p>

            “Change is the only constant in life / A man devoid of hope and conscious of
            being so has ceased to belong to the future”
            Our school’s motto, “Big Hearts and Brave Minds” urges us to fly beyond
            the frontiers of our imagination. Fr. Agnel school, not only aims to bring a
            difference through education, but also enhances the individualism and
            skills of the students. The school provides its scholars with the ideal
            environment where they can grow up to be confident, proficient risk takers,
            and through their valiant efforts, contribute towards the growth of the
            community they belong to.
            Horizons of change perfectly resonates with the school’s ideology of
            guiding its students to be a better version of themselves. It is a port in a
            storm for people and firmly believes that curiosity and wonder lead us to
            the unimaginable power of creativity. Therefore, we introduce to you TEDxFather Agnel School, a platform
            where young individuals discover their
            identities, passions, and a sense of purpose, enabling them to transcend
            their boundaries. Our goal is to inform and inspire the young minds,
            igniting discussions and fostering meaningful connections.
            The TEDx platform will be graced by influential presenters who will not just
            deliver thought-provoking talks, but also inspire young and budding minds
            to persist in their endeavors and continue striving for loftier achievements.
            The students will be exposed to novel experiences, offering them a glimpse
            into the real world. TEDx Talks cover a wide array of subjects, including
            science, education, arts, and more, providing not only informative content
            but also captivating and enjoyable presentations.
            Consequently, our school has partnered with remarkable individuals who
            have brought about positive change in various ways for this thrilling
            occasion.
